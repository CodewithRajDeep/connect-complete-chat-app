initiatives. This app helps in providing seamlessly communication as well as refined interaction between the employeers as well as
team members to increase the work ratio within Kanban or either scrum sprint over 35-40%.

an iOS or text message on an iPhone or Android device from a friend, an email from a co-worker on Microsoft or Gmail, a team chat in a Slack or Microsoft Teams
workspace, or even instant messaging through social media. These messaging and real-time chat applications play an important role in how the world interacts today,
due to their immediacy and vast capabilities.
